# Bank Binary Classification (Kaggle Competition)

This repository contains my work on the Kaggle competition **Binary Classification with a Bank Dataset**.  
The goal of the competition is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and financial features.

## 🚀 Models & Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with `ydata-profiling`.  
2. **Feature Engineering** (encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical).  
3. **Model Training** with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
4. **Evaluation** using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## 📈 Results
- Best model: `Random Forest Classifier`  
- F1-score: `XX.XX`  
- Accuracy: `YY.YY%`
